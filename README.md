#Hack19: International Flutter Hackathon [https://flutterhackathon.com/]

The GLN team selected the "Job Finding" topic.

As a result we propose a prototype of the application, where job search become more fun and user-friendly.

After user sign-in to the platform, AI engine (not implemented yet) will do skill matching for job post and a jobseeker, and propose a bunch of suitable jobs to the user. Jobseeker can swipe right and left to save interested vacancies to observer later (like and don't like).

On a second layer (swipe up), jobseeker do more detailed analysis of a vacancy and make a decision, either go for it or not.
If accept, user will see a detailed progress graph with current status of the application.

We believe that such interaction will make a job search more exciting for candidates.

At GLN we live, breath and sometimes eat code 24/7. yes that is not impossible ;)

_P.S. Flutter developers feel free to join us at [GLN](https://globalline.my/), for the first b2b application development with Flutter FE._
